# IoT LPWAN Protocol

Businesses can establish and manage their own Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) server, which eliminates the need for an administrator for the LPWAN Protocol. This self-operated system requires the locking of six million MXC tokens, which functions similarly to popular blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea or any other protocol.

To ensure seamless functionality, any brand of miner that wishes to participate must run its own customized version of the LPWAN Protocol. In addition, any sensor or Internet of Things (IoT) non-fungible token (NFT) utilizing this system will be required to pay for the services provided by the miners.

By implementing this decentralized network architecture, businesses can have greater control over their LPWAN server while maintaining the necessary security and operational standards. This approach offers a more secure, flexible, and cost-effective solution for businesses looking to streamline their IoT data management processes.

A more detailed illustration is as follows:

## MEPs

MEP stands for MXC Evolution Proposal. Each MEP will be a proposal document providing information to the MXC zkEVM ecosystem and community.


Here is the list of subjects of MEPs:
