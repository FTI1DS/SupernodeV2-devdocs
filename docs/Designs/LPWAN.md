# IoT LPWAN Protocol

Businesses can establish and manage their own Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) server, which eliminates the need for an administrator for the LPWAN Protocol. This self-operated system requires the locking of six million MXC tokens, which functions similarly to popular blockchain marketplaces like OpenSea or any other protocol.

To ensure seamless functionality, any brand of miner that wishes to participate must run its own customized version of the LPWAN Protocol. In addition, any sensor or Internet of Things (IoT) non-fungible token (NFT) utilizing this system will be required to pay for the services provided by the miners.

By implementing this decentralized network architecture, businesses can have greater control over their LPWAN server while maintaining the necessary security and operational standards. This approach offers a more secure, flexible, and cost-effective solution for businesses looking to streamline their IoT data management processes.

LPWAN Protocol fulfils:
1. Confirms the miner NFT belongs to the miner
2. Submit IoT data on-chain
3. Holding the mining pool from block rewards
4. All data API are exposed
5. Push the firmware updates for the miners
6. Removed Sudo, all the transactions done by Smart Contract
7. Submit the mining data on-chain
8. To be included to MXC explorer for data up and down
