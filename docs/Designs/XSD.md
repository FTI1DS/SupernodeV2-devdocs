# MXC Stable Coin (draft)

MXC will be the largest Layer-3 IoT solution on Arbitrum ecosystem, bringing tremendous real-world items to NFT world and data to the blockchain. Undoubtedly each real-world item and each piece of data has its own value, and this kind of value is not from pure financial speculations, the value comes from real economy that serves our food, sports, transportation every day. 

MXC is going to leverage the real-world economy to build the first stable coin backed by items like Gin, Bike sensors, Nike shoes etc. Along with the tokens created on DataHighway like Ride token, Park token and MXC, DHX, BTC, the MXC stable coin has a basket ranging from NFT to tokens to back the stable coin from the real-world economy.



As IoT [Swap](https://wannsee-swap.mxc.com/) shows, the IoT tokens like Ride token would be the major applications that use MXC network and DHX blockchain to build their own data economy. These Ride and Park token can be swapped in MXC Swap conveniently, through XSD trading pair. XSD will be the first IoT stable coin that are backed by real-world assets and data values, meanwhile serving for the digital and real-world economy.

MXProtocol design and DataHighway DB both are aimed for validating the XSD stable coinï¼Œwhich is pegged to US dollars at start in 1:2 manner. Along with the NFC, LoraWAN and Satellite technologies, users are able to verify and validate the value of XSD are backed by collateral like Gin 1689 NFTs, and MXC/DHX/Ride tokens.


NFTs and tokens are used as collateral to back the XSD, the XSD/USD conversion rate is to make sure the XSD can trade with USD from 1 XSD = 2 USD for the future market fluctuation. Normally the NFTs are issued by companies and manufacturers to let communities to burn XSD and get a collateral NFT, in the whole reserve of the MXC there are 20 percent of cryptocurrencies as collateral, the rest of 80% should be IoT NFTs that are backed by real-world assets.

The ratio of the 20/80 percent should be adjusted by MXC Reserve, namely MXC DAO in referendum : https://snapshot.org/#/mxcpop.eth

In the following example, it shows how XSD is backed:

| Collateral   | Value USD | Quantity | Total USD | Percentage |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| M2Pro NFT    | 2700      | 10       | 27000     | 72%        |
| Gin 1689 NFT | 100       | 30       | 3000      | 8%         |
| MXC token    | 1         | 2000     | 2000      | 5.3%       |
| Ride token   | 2         | 100      | 200       | 0.6%       |
| BTC          | 5000      | 1        | 5000      | 13.3%      |
| DHX token    | 100       | 3        | 300       | 0.8%       |
|              |           |          | 37500     | 100%       |

This collateral can create **18750 XSD** with XSD/USD convertion rate 2. When people want to redeem let's say 100 XSD ride token, they will also have to reduce the amount of NFT value according to the 20/80 ratio, otherwise the burning of XSD won't be successful.

:::tip XSD/USD rate
Every time the XSD is mint will need to follow the most updated conversion rate between XSD/USD decided by the market.

In this case, the users will try to redeem one Gin 1689 NFT to get 100USD worth of NFT, and also to get 25USD of any token, like 25USD MXC token. So the user needs to burn 250 xUSD, in return he gets 1 Gin 1689 NFT and 25USD MXC

| Collateral redeemed | Value USD | Quantity | Total Burnt XSD | Percentage |
|---------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Gin 1689 NFT        | 100       | 1        | 200       | 80%        |
| MXC token           | 1         | 25       | 50       | 20%        |
|                     |           |          | 250       | 100%       |




## Insurance
The goal of XSD and MXC, DHX is to enable every person/company to create XSD and circulate in their own economy to support their business logic, eventually it is to change the current situation that all the stable coins and Fiat currencies are backed by US treasury bonds, while US treasury bonds are like 30 trillion USD and US treasury and Fed Reserve only got 4 trillion gold or other reserves.

We need to peg this world better with the assets created by people and used by people. Also we need to deal with systematic risks if the de-peg happens. Central banks proposes to print more money to solve the problem. MXC DAO proposes that we should add a 10% insurance on the top of the every XSD mint to deal with the systematic risks.

This 10% insurance can be paid every year to make sure even if the depeg happened like the collateral is gone or the overall overall collateral price is reduced due to a certain black swan event.

The insurance should be an option at the end of the minting process.

## XSD exchange rate with USD

When the XSD economy is getting bigger and bigger, the MXC DAO should see the 1:2 exchange rate will fluctuate due to the demand of XSD is higher than USD and people lose trust in USD. 

This is due to the volatility of the Fed Reserve to create more balance sheet and run-off the balance sheet without any anchor, XSD holder should aim for a certain development that the unit price of the collateral like watch, shoes, wines are defined by the unit of a XSD and no longer will be a USD.

Also the majority of DEX trading pair would be XSD trading pair will define the new stable coin economy.

## Lending protocol
It is expected that people will borrow XSD and lend XSD to generate stable APY, there are a lot of similar lending protocols like AAVE will move to DataHighway parachain to enable XSD economy active.
