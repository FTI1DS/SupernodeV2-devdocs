##Introducing MXC zkEVM Supernode V2

Delve into the world of MXC SupernodeV2, a groundbreaking development in the realm of decentralized solutions. This Type 1 ZK-EVM ZK-Rollup, synonymous with Ethereum capabilities, is built atop Arbitrum harnessing the power of Taiko ZK.

MXC stands at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, with a clear vision of becoming the Ethereum for the Internet of Things (IoT). Our ensemble includes seasoned developers and blockchain aficionados, all of whom possess an intrinsic understanding of the ever-evolving Web3 landscape.

Now anchored on Arbitrum, the MXC token elevates IoT scaling. It's not just a token; it's an innovative solution providing diverse IoT functionalities. From monitoring parking spaces to streamlining garbage collection in cities like Korea and New York, its applications are vast. Envisioned to be the next big thing after Ethereum in the IoT space, the token is poised to facilitate [sensor token offerings](https://www.mxc.org/blog/introducing-initial-sensor-offering-iso) and [NFT issuance](https://medium.com/mxc/mxprotocol-enters-multi-billion-dollar-nfc-market-4bb4a4a3e382) and [NFT issuances for tangible goods](https://hackmd.io/3PYPxJ0nQ7W_YvEqtBGqzQ).
