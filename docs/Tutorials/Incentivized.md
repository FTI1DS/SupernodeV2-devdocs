Up to 10% of the circulation will participate in the airdrop, when the MXC token price listed on Coinbase Pro reaches a certain threshold at the announced block height, it will open the more percentages like the following table shows:

| Participation wallets | Total amounts of zkMXC token |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| Under $0.2            | 53,299,316                    |

There is no lock-up for zkEVM when claiming and will be LP with zkMXC/MXC



### User airdrop eligibility details

A points system was used to determine the number of tokens that airdrop recipients can claim. Points criteria was focused primarily on MXC zkEVM; however, there was a small subset of criteria applied to activity on DataHighway.com. Points earned on DataHighway.com could either bring a user up to 4 points total, or give them one additional point if they had already scored 4 points or more on MXC zkEVM. You earn maximum one point per qualifying action performed before the snapshot date. Point scores were capped at 30.

Users are required to mint ARB-ZK NFTs in Arbitrum One for participating the airdrop.

Additionally, as the criteria and design of the airdrop as a whole was intentioned to reward early adopters, points scored (minimum of three) before announcement link (later available) are worth twice as much as points scored after.

**Qualifying actions:**

Points earned on MXC zkEVM

 1. Create Initial Sensor Offerings (Name of the token created should contain an IoT sensor)
2. Create IoT NFTs (Name of the NFT created should be a real-world object)
3. Run MXC zkEVM Supernodes
4. Creating a MXC zkEVM wallet
 5. Conducted more than 40 transactions or interacted with more than 40 different smart contracts
 6. Conducted more than 100 transactions or interacted with more than 100 different smart contracts
 7. Conducted more than 250 transactions or interacted with more than 250 different smart contracts
 8. Conducted more than 1000 transactions or interacted with more than 1000 different smart contracts
 9. Conducted Sensor Tokens/IoT NFTs transactions exceeding in the aggregate 50,000 MXC
 10. Conducted Sensor Tokens/IoT NFTs transactions exceeding in the aggregate 100,000 MXC
 11. Conducted Sensor Tokens/IoT NFTs transactions exceeding in the aggregate 250,000 MXC
 12. Minting Hexagon map NFT
 13. Creating MXC name service domain
 14. **Referral: Claim the [MOON token](https://contract_addr) and send to the referrer person, no upper limit. The referee has to collect at least 5 points to make the moon token points count.**



Points earned on DataHighway.com 

 1. Holding any BEP-20 DHX 
 2. Conducted more than three transactions
 3. Conducted more than five transactions
 4. Conducted more than ten transactions

As described earlier, points scored before and after announcement were weighted differently. Points scored before announcement were worth twice as much as points scored after -- as a result any points scored after announcement resulted in half as much of an allocation per point shown in the table above. If an address only became fully eligible (minimum of three points) post-announcement, all points scored counted as post-announcement points. Thus, the minimum airdrop entitlement is 625 tokens, half of the minimum entitlement in the table above; the maximum airdrop entitlement is 40000 tokens.

**User protections:**

To prevent bots from taking advantage of the airdrop, a number of anti-Sybil rules were established:

 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet transactions have all occurred within a 48-hour period, **one point is subtracted**.
 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet balance is less than 500 MXC, **and** if the wallet hasn't interacted with more than one smart contract, **one point is subtracted**.
 - If an airdrop recipient's wallet address has been identified as a Sybil address during the Hop protocol bounty program **the recipient is disqualified**. 

Refer to [Sybil Hunting](https://github.com/mxczkevm/sybil-detection) to learn more about the Sybil mitigation methodology. Refer to our [Sybil accounts](https://github.com/mxczkevm/sybil-detection) concept document for a conceptual introduction to Sybil accounts.




### Vesting and lockup details

While the user and DAO airdrops will be available after the claiming immediately, the zkMXC will be distributed to ARB-ZKL3 holders in Arbitrum One and have a swap pair with MXC and ARB.
